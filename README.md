# daybed.js

A library to use [Daybed](http://daybed.readthedocs.org) in your Javascript
applications.

## Rationale

Note that **Daybed** is a REST backend, and does not require any particular library
to be used in your applications.

**daybed.js** brings some helpers to ease the manipulation of sessions and asynchronous
operations.

    Check out [backbone-daybed](https://github.com/spiral-project/backbone-daybed),
    which brings Backbone.js helpers with *jQuery* instead of *daybed.js*.

We take advantage of [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise), which may require [a polyfill](https://www.npmjs.org/package/promise-polyfill) on some browsers.

Optional authentication relies on [Hawk](https://github.com/hueniverse/hawk).
Tokens are manipulated with [SJCL](http://bitwiseshiftleft.github.io/sjcl/).


## Example


### Setup

As the main developper of your app, it's common to start by defining a *model*
on the Daybed server.

Let's say you want to build an app to list the books you would like to read.

First, we start a new session on Daybed, and keep the token as if it was an *admin* password.

```javascript

    var server = 'https://daybed.lolnet.org/v1/';
    var session = Daybed.startSession(server)
                        .then(function (session) {
                          console.log("Keep this somewhere safe " + session.token);
                        });

```

Then, you can keep using the same session object, or create a new one reusing
the *admin* token you obtained :

```javascript

    var session = new Daybed.Session(server, { token: 'q89ryh..dcc' });

```

As the application author, you define a new model for your books list :

```javascript

    var books = new Daybed.Model({
      definition: {
        title: 'book',
        description: "The list of books to read",
        fields: [{
          name: "title",
          type: "string",
          label: "Title",
        },
        {
          name: "author",
          type: "string",
          label: "Author"
        },
        {
          name: "summary",
          type: "string",
          label: "Summary"
        }]
      }
    });

    var modelId = 'myapp:books';

    books.save({id: modelId, session: session})
      .then(function (created) {
        console.log('Model created', created);
      })
      .catch(function (error, xhr) {
        console.error('An error occured', error, xhr);
      });

```

As a model owner, you can adjust the permissions. For example, you can decide
that everyone can create, read, edit and delete their own records :

```javascript

    session.savePermissions(modelId, {
      'Everyone': ['create_record', 'read_own_records', 'delete_own_records',
                   'read_definition']
    })
    .then(function (permissions) {
      console.log('Permissions set', permissions)
    });

```

**You're done** !

You can now implement your application, and let your users manage their records !


### In your application

Let's say, we want each user to store her session token in the local storage.
The first time, a new token will be created :

```javascript

    var token = localStorage.getItem('myapp:books:token');
    var session = Daybed.startSession(server, { token: token })
                        .then(function (session) {
                          localStorage.setItem('myapp:books:token', session.token);
                        });

```

Fetch the list of records :

```javascript


    var books;
    var modelId = 'myapp:books';

    session.loadModel(modelId)
           .then(loaded);

    function loaded(model) {
      books = model;
      var records = books.records();
      console.log(records.length + ' record(s).');
    }

```

Create new records :

```javascript

    console.log('Current session ', books.session);

    books.add({
      title: "Critique de la raison num√©rique",
      author: "Dominique Mazuet, Delga",
      summary: "http://www.librairie-quilombo.org/spip.php?article5532"
    });

    books.save()
         .catch(function (error, xhr) {
           console.error('An error occured', error, xhr);
         });

```


### A word about tokens

Tokens are your authentication credentials, you can share yours, by using
URL location hash for example (instead of localStorage) :

```javascript

    var token = window.location.hash.slice(1);
    var session = Daybed.startSession({ token: token })
                        .then(function (session) {
                          window.location.hash = session.token;
                        });

```

This way, each user can share her identity on several devices, and even share
her
own privileges and collaborate with the entire world!


You can also create new ones and assign them to specific permissions:


```javascript

    Daybed.getToken()
          .then(function(credentials) {
      var token = credentials.token;
      console.log(token + ' will be allowed to delete any record');

      var permissions = {};
      permissions[token] = ['delete_all_records'];
      session.savePermissions(modelId, permissions);
    });

```
